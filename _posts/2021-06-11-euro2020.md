With EURO 2020 underway now is a good time to assess your favoured country's historical results in international competition.

Using data compiled by [Mart Jürisoo](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017), and taking inspiration from a recent 
[FT graphic](https://www.ft.com/content/e365f142-bcdb-4b1d-a7de-cea2f852f9dc) of the results of England and Scotland throughout history, I have developed a
[dashboard](https://mjacobsdata.shinyapps.io/football-rivalries/) detailing the head-to-head for each set of footballing rivals selected.

The brief code extract below gives details of how to extract and load the data set to R.

```r
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)

##Download the data from Github
download.file('https://github.com/martj42/international_results/raw/master/results.csv', 
              'results.csv',
               mode="wb")
##Load data into R
international <-read.csv('results.csv', 
                          header = TRUE, 
                          encoding = "UTF-8")
                          
##Reformat date field
international$date <-as.Date(international$date)

##Remove pending games and missing data
international <-filter(international, 
                       !is.na(home_score) |!is.na(away_score))

```
 
Enjoy the [dashboard](https://mjacobsdata.shinyapps.io/football-rivalries/) and the games…and good luck!
