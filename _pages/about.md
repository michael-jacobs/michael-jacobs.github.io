# ABOUT

I am a seasoned statistician and data professional, with close to 20 years of experience, encompassing the UK Civil Service, the Financial Times, the United Nations and the OECD. Since January 2020 I have been working as an independent consultant from Barcelona, with a focus on official statistics, international comparisons and the efficient processing and analysis of data. 

In short, I enjoy interpreting statistics and data to tell stories, to help decision makers and to solve real world problems. I am particularly interested in the effective use of data visualisations to inform public opinion, as well as the use of automated data collections from online sources in official statistics.
