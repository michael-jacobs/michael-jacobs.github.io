# About

  I am an experienced statistician and data professional, with a career spanning close to 20 years, encompassing the UK Government Statistical Service, the Financial Times, the United Nations and the OECD. Since January 2020 I have been working as an independent consultant from Barcelona, with a focus on official statistics, international comparisons and the efficient processing and analysis of data.  

In short, I enjoy interpreting statistics and data to tell stories, to help decision makers and to solve real world problems. I am particularly interested in the effective use of data visualisations to inform public opinion, as well as the use of automated data collections from online sources in official statistics.  

For examples of my work, please see details of some [recent projects](https://michael-jacobs.github.io/recent_projects/) as well as [my blog](https://michael-jacobs.github.io/posts/).
