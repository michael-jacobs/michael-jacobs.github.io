I offer a range of services to organisations who want to gather and exploit new and existing data to provide actionable insights to decision makers.


**DATA PROCESSING, AUTOMATION & ANALYSIS**   
From compiling and merging data from disparate sources, to working with very big data sets, I design and implement processes to enable the automation of data cleaning, aggregation and interogation.

**WEB SCRAPING**    
If you want to gather data from an online source but don't know where to start, I can build bespoke web scraping tools to enable automated collection of large volumes of data on a regular and consistent basis, summarising and interpreting the raw information to provide new analysis and insights.

**HR ANALYTICS**  
Is your organisation competitive in terms of staff remuneration? I can assist with salary benchmarking studies to help answer this and other HR related questions. I also have in-depth expertise in the field of cost of living analysis, specifically in relation to the setting and adjustment of salaries.
