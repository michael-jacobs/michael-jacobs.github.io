Below are some recent examples of my work and testimonials from clients. 

## World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) *(MAR 2020 – JULY 2020)*
Working as part of a small team of consultants I lead work to build, clean, analyse and quality assure a database of indicators on performance of veterinary services.

The resultant centralised database now serves as a single source of this data, enabling greater comparability and analytical use of the OIE’s existing data. Suggested improvements to survey instruments will also improve the efficiency of collecting data of good quality in the future. 

## The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
**Public Governance directorate *(MAR 2020 – OCT 2020)***  
I managed and analysed a series of pilot surveys conducted internationally to assess factors that impact on the engagement of National Civil Servants administering European Union Development funds.

> "Michael added much value to our project analysing employee data in three countries. He provided insights into our methods and results, was extremely 
> responsive to changing needs and requests, and delivered high quality analysis. The project would not have been possible without Michael's contributions and
> I would recommend him without hesitation." 
**Natalia Nolan, Policy Analyst at OECD**

**International Service for Remuneration and Pensions *(MAR 2020 – APR 2021)***
Working in collaboration with ISRP to assist NATO with the technical implementation of a new salary scale for civilian staff. I modelled the projected financial implications and developed a Shiny based online interactive salary calculator to assist communication of the new system to staff.

**Directorate for Education and Skills *(DEC 2020 – March 2021)***
In my capacity as a consultant, I was given responsibility for the development of indicators on Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC). The overall aim of this work was to enhance quality control and comparability of data gathered from OECD countries, to ensure harmonisation in the understanding, interpretability, and analysis of the related indicators. This involved working closely with various working groups, to present, develop and modify a series of proposals in relation to ECEC indicators to published in [Education at a Glance](https://www.oecd.org/education/education-at-a-glance/). This work resulted in the production of a paper which I drafted and presented.
